## 1) What have I been doing this week? What skills did I need?

My first week was mainly focused on understanding the organization and the two projects I will be working on. Rather than immediately contributing ideas, I spent most of the week observing, asking questions, and trying to understand how everything functions internally.

I was welcomed by the team and introduced to the department structure. I received access to internal systems, communication platforms, shared documentation, and the WordPress. A large part of the week was dedicated to understanding who is responsible for what, how decisions are made, and how projects move from discussion to execution.

My mentor also walked me through the WordPress. I learned how pages are structured, how content blocks are edited, and how updates are managed. This helped me realize that UX ideas need to be technically realistic.

In addition, I was asked to review the design system and branding guidelines of the European Heat Pump Association. Going through their visual identity, typography, layout rules, and communication tone gave me a clearer understanding of how consistency supports professionalism and trust.

During this week, I was introduced to two main projects:

- The redesign of the Heat Pump Forum website (https://hp-forum.eu/)
- The redesign of the membership page on the EHPA website (https://ehpa.org/about-ehpa/join-us/)

The goal of the forum project is to improve UX and UI and increase conversion, especially encouraging users to sign up and potentially become investors.

The membership project focuses on redesigning the page and transforming the current benefits PDF into a more digital and interactive experience to strengthen the value proposition.

My role during Week 1 was mainly observational. I attended meetings, took structured notes, asked clarification questions, and began analyzing both websites independently. I started identifying areas where messaging could be clearer and where structure could be improved, but I did not propose major changes yet.

This week required active listening, analytical thinking, structured documentation, and adaptability to new systems.

## 2) Deadlines: Were they met?

There were no strict production deadlines during Week 1. The main objective was onboarding and familiarization.

All planned onboarding activities were completed, and I attended all scheduled meetings. No deadlines were missed.

## 3) What did I learn this week? In what way?

This week helped me understand that website redesign begins with strategy and structure rather than visuals.

I learned that:

- UX improvements must align with business goals
- Branding consistency is essential
- Every change needs justification
- Understanding internal workflows is necessary before contributing

I also realized that conversion is largely about clarity. If users do not clearly understand the offer, design alone will not solve the issue.

## 4) Environment & Collaboration

The onboarding process was structured and supportive. I felt comfortable asking questions and was clearly introduced to responsibilities and communication flows.

Even as an intern, I felt included in discussions rather than just observing passively.

## 5) What am I already doing well? Where can I improve?

### Strengths

- Structured note-taking
- Careful observation before acting
- Awareness of branding consistency
- Professional communication

### Areas for improvement

- Becoming faster at identifying high-impact UX issues
- Gaining confidence when sharing ideas in meetings
- Improving prioritization skills

## 6) Positive Point

Week 1 gave me clarity and context. I now understand both projects and the organizational structure, which makes me feel prepared to contribute more actively in the coming weeks.
