## 1) What have I been doing this week? What skills did I need?

My first week was dedicated to onboarding, understanding the organization's structure, and being introduced to the two main web projects I will assist with during the coming month.

### Organizational Introduction

At the beginning of the week, I was welcomed by the team and introduced to the department. I received access to internal systems, shared documentation, communication platforms, and the WordPress backend.

A significant part of this week was focused on understanding how the organization operates internally:

- How the department is structured
- Who is responsible for strategic decisions
- Who handles technical implementation
- Who manages content and communication
- How projects move from discussion to execution
- Where assets, documentation, and design files are stored

Understanding these structures helped me gain clarity on workflows and responsibilities before actively contributing.

### Introduction to WordPress

My mentor provided a detailed walkthrough of the WordPress backend. I was introduced to:

- Dashboard navigation
- Page structures and templates
- Editing content blocks
- Publishing updates
- Theme and plugin limitations
- How design and technical constraints influence UX decisions

The goal was not immediate implementation, but understanding the system so that future suggestions would be technically realistic and aligned with the existing infrastructure.

### Introduction to the Company's Design System and Branding

To ensure that my future design suggestions are consistent with the company's identity, I was provided with their design system and branding guidelines.

I was asked to review:

- Brand colors and typography
- Layout and spacing principles
- Visual hierarchy standards
- Logo usage rules
- UI component guidelines
- Brand tone and communication style

This was important so that I could:

- Understand the company's visual language
- Align UX/UI suggestions with branding
- Avoid proposing ideas that conflict with established identity
- Make more impactful and consistent recommendations

Reviewing the design system gave me a clearer understanding of how branding supports credibility, trust, and professionalism.

### Introduction to the Two Projects

I was introduced to two main projects that I will assist with over the next month.

#### 1. The Heat Pump Forum Website

The first project focuses on redesigning the Heat Pump Forum website (https://hp-forum.eu/).

Project goals:

- Improve UX (user experience)
- Improve UI (visual interface)
- Create a clearer and more intuitive user journey
- Increase conversion rates

The strategic focus is to:

- Make it easier and more attractive for users to sign up for the forum
- Encourage visitors not only to participate but also to become investors

During the introduction, I learned about:

- The forum's target audience
- Its current structure
- Existing navigation challenges
- Areas where clarity could be improved
- Long-term strategic goals of the platform

This project is already in progress and changes have started to be applied. I forgot to record a video of how the forum website looked before we started making updates.

#### 2. The Membership "Join Us" Webpage

The second project focuses on the "Join Us" membership page of the European Heat Pump Association (https://ehpa.org/about-ehpa/join-us/).

Current situation:

The page currently:

- Describes membership categories
- Lists benefits in text format
- Provides additional details in a downloadable PDF
- Includes contact information for application

While the content is complete, much of the value proposition is presented in a static format.

Project goals:

The redesign aims to:

- Improve structure and readability
- Make the value proposition clearer
- Increase membership conversion
- Translate the static benefits PDF into a digital, interactive experience
- Create a smoother user journey from information -> interest -> action

The focus is to make the page:

- More engaging
- More scannable
- More conversion-driven
- Better aligned with modern UX practices

### My Role During Week 1

During this first week, my role was primarily observational and analytical.

I:

- Attended meetings related to both projects
- Observed discussions about redesign strategy and priorities
- Took structured notes
- Asked clarification questions
- Began analyzing both websites independently
- Provided minor suggestions related to clarity and structure

Since this was my first week, my contributions were intentionally limited. The emphasis was on understanding context before proposing significant structural changes.

However, I did start identifying:

- Minor usability inconsistencies
- Areas where messaging could be clearer
- Opportunities for improved content hierarchy

Skills required this week:

- Active listening
- Structured documentation
- Analytical thinking
- Learning new systems (WordPress)
- Understanding branding alignment
- Observing conversion-oriented design thinking

## 2) Deadlines: Were they met?

The main objective of Week 1 was onboarding and familiarization.

There were no strict production deadlines. All onboarding activities were completed as planned. I attended all scheduled meetings and successfully reviewed both websites.

No deadlines were missed.

## 3) What did I learn this week? In what way?

This week helped me understand how digital redesign projects function in a professional environment.

I learned:

- That UX improvements must align with business objectives
- That branding consistency is crucial for credibility
- That website redesign begins with strategy, not visuals
- That professional discussions involve balancing constraints and priorities
- That understanding organizational structure is essential before contributing

I also realized that increasing conversion is not only about design aesthetics, but about clarity, structure, and guiding users toward action.

## 4) Environment & Collaboration

The onboarding process was structured and gradual. I felt supported and encouraged to ask questions.

Being clearly introduced to responsibilities and communication flows reduced uncertainty. I now understand:

- Who to approach for technical questions
- Who manages strategic direction
- How decisions are made
- How feedback is incorporated

Even as an intern, I felt included in discussions and given the opportunity to contribute small insights.

To improve, I plan to further study UX principles related to conversion optimization and prepare concise reasoning before presenting suggestions in meetings.

## 6) Positive Point

The first week provided clarity, structure, and realistic expectations. Being introduced early to two strategic projects made the internship feel meaningful.

Although my role is currently focused on observation and analysis, I now have a clear understanding of both projects and the organization's workflow. This foundation will allow me to contribute more actively in the coming weeks.
