## 1) What have I been doing this week? What skills did I need?

My first week was primarily focused on onboarding and understanding how the organization works.

On Monday, I was welcomed and introduced to my colleagues and the department I will be working with. I received the necessary equipment and access credentials for internal systems and the WordPress backend.

During Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, I mainly observed and learned:

- How tasks are distributed within the department  
- Who is responsible for different types of decisions  
- Who to contact depending on the situation  
- How communication flows between team members  

My mentor also walked me through the WordPress backend in detail. I was shown:

- How to log in and navigate the dashboard  
- How pages are structured  
- How content blocks are edited  
- How updates are managed  
- What limitations exist within the current setup  

Later in the week, I was introduced to the first project I will be working on: the Heat Pump Forum website (https://hp-forum.eu/).

My mentor explained:
- The purpose of the forum  
- Its target audience  
- Its current structure  
- The general intention to improve its UX and UI  

An existing document containing improvement ideas was shared with me. I was asked to review the website and begin adding structured UX/UI suggestions to that document.

On Friday, I started analyzing the website and drafting observations. My work at this stage focused on:

- Reviewing content clarity  
- Checking navigation logic  
- Observing visual consistency  
- Identifying areas that felt confusing or unclear  

The purpose was not to redesign the website immediately, but to prepare structured observations that we will discuss next week.

This required careful observation, structured documentation, and critical thinking.



## 2) Deadlines: were they met? If not, why?

The main objective of Week 1 was onboarding and beginning the UX/UI suggestion document.

Onboarding activities were completed as planned. I also started working on the shared document on Friday.

The discussion and decision-making phase is scheduled for next Tuesday. During that meeting, my mentor and I will review the suggestions together and decide which ideas should move forward.

No deadlines were missed during this week.


## 3) What did I learn this week? In what way?

This week helped me understand how a professional environment operates beyond an academic setting.

I learned:

- How responsibilities are structured within a department  
- How WordPress is used in a real organizational context  
- That website improvements begin with structured documentation before any implementation  
- That it is important to observe and understand context before proposing major changes  

I also learned that clarity and structure in documentation are essential when multiple people collaborate on improvements.



## 4) Environment & collaboration

The onboarding process was structured and gradual. I felt encouraged to ask questions and take notes.

Being clearly introduced to the hierarchy and knowing who to approach in different situations reduced uncertainty.

The team environment felt professional and collaborative. Even as an intern, I was given the opportunity to contribute rather than only observe.



## 5) What am I already doing well? Where can I improve?

Strengths:
- Structured note-taking  
- Careful review of content and layout  
- Asking relevant clarification questions  
- Maintaining a professional tone in written suggestions  

Growth areas:
- Becoming faster in identifying key usability issues  
- Gaining confidence when presenting my thoughts  
- Improving prioritization thinking  

To improve, I will continue developing a structured way of evaluating webpages and prepare concise explanations for my suggestions before meetings.



## 6) Positive point

The first week provided a clear structure and direction. Being involved in a real project early on made the internship feel meaningful and motivating.
