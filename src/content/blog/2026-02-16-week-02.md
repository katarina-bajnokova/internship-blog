## 1) What have I been doing this week? What skills did I need?

In the second week, my role shifted from observation to active contribution, especially regarding the Heat Pump Forum redesign under the European Heat Pump Association.

After analyzing the website in Week 1, I began proposing structured changes. I shared my insights on improving the clarity of the value proposition, strengthening calls-to-action, and making the distinction between joining the forum and becoming an investor clearer.

These suggestions were discussed within the team. Some ideas were adjusted, some refined, and others expanded upon. Through these discussions, we began creating a visual draft of the redesigned forum homepage.

The draft is still in progress, but it allowed us to visualize a clearer structure and improved hierarchy. Throughout the week, we continued refining it by adjusting section order, simplifying elements, and aligning everything with the design system.

This week required more applied skills: UX reasoning, conversion-focused thinking, communication, and collaboration.

## 2) Deadlines: Were they met?

There were no strict implementation deadlines yet, as the project is still in the drafting phase.

However, we successfully developed an initial draft structure for the redesigned forum homepage. The project remains iterative and ongoing.

## 3) What did I learn this week? In what way?

This week taught me that design is collaborative and iterative. Ideas evolve through feedback and discussion.

I learned that:

- Supporting suggestions with clear reasoning is essential
- Conversion improvements require structural clarity
- Compromise is part of professional teamwork
- Initial drafts are starting points, not final solutions

I also noticed that I felt more confident speaking in meetings compared to Week 1.

## 4) Environment & Collaboration

The team environment remained constructive and open. Feedback was direct but respectful, which made it easier to contribute ideas.

I felt more integrated into the decision-making process this week.
