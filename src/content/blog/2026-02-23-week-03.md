## 1) What have I been doing this week? What skills did I need?

In Week 3, we focused specifically on the homepage of the membership section of the European Heat Pump Association.

The first step was to logically redesign the structure and hierarchy of the page. Before discussing visual details, we analyzed whether the existing structure truly supports conversion. Our main objective is clear:

- Increase conversion rate
- Spark curiosity about becoming a member
- Make the sign-up process feel simple and accessible
- Create a more welcoming and engaging first impression

This week was dedicated primarily to prototyping. We reorganized content sections, redefined hierarchy, clarified benefit communication, and strengthened calls-to-action, all within early structural drafts.

This is how the membership homepage has been looking right now:

<div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; gap:1rem; align-items:stretch; margin:0.75rem 0 1.25rem;">
  <div>
    <p><strong>Current membership homepage</strong></p>
    <video autoplay muted playsinline loop width="100%" preload="metadata">
      <source src="/internship-blog/videos/membershiip.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
  </div>

    </video>
    <p>This redesign is still not the final one. It is still under process, and we are continuing to refine structure, messaging, and conversion flow.</p>
  </div>

I suggested several structural and messaging improvements and presented my ideas clearly during discussions. Many of my suggestions were taken into consideration and applied within the prototype, particularly regarding:

- Section order and narrative flow
- Making benefits more visible and scannable
- Clarifying the value proposition earlier on the page
- Improving the logic behind conversion touchpoints

The goal is to guide users smoothly from awareness to interest to action. The homepage should not just provide information; it should actively encourage users to consider membership.

This week required:

- Strategic UX thinking
- Conversion-oriented structuring
- Clear presentation of ideas
- Collaborative refinement
- Prototyping logic

The focus was on building a strong foundation before moving into implementation.

## 2) Deadlines: Were they met?

The project is still in its drafting phase. This week was dedicated to creating and refining the first prototype version of the membership homepage.

We are currently awaiting further feedback from colleagues and managers. Their input will help us refine the structure and messaging further.

Ideally, by next week:

- We will finalize the homepage structure
- Approve the refined version
- Begin implementing the agreed changes

The project remains on track according to internal planning.

## 3) What did I learn this week? In what way?

This week reinforced how important structure and clarity are in conversion-focused design.

I learned that:

- Prototyping allows strategy to become tangible
- Clear reasoning strengthens the acceptance of ideas
- Conversion increases when benefits are immediate and visible
- Feedback loops are essential before final implementation

I also noticed growth in my confidence. I contributed more actively, presented ideas more clearly, and saw several of my suggestions integrated into the evolving prototype.

## 4) Environment & Collaboration

The collaboration this week was highly constructive and strategic. Discussions were focused on long-term positioning and conversion impact.

I felt increasingly involved in decision-making. Being able to see my ideas applied within the prototype strengthened my sense of contribution and responsibility.

## 5) What am I already doing well? Where can I improve?

### Strengths

- Logical structuring of content
- Conversion-focused mindset
- Clear communication of ideas
- Active participation in refinement discussions

### Areas for improvement

- Moving from idea to structured prototype even faster
- Being more assertive when defending strong suggestions
- Continuing to support proposals with measurable reasoning

---

## 6) Positive Point

Week 3 marked another step forward in responsibility and impact.

Moving from analysis to actively shaping and prototyping the membership homepage, with several of my ideas being implemented, made the work feel practical, strategic, and meaningful.

I am looking forward to refining the page further next week and beginning implementation.
